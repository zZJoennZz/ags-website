            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">1. Listening helps you think in English.</h3>
                <p>When a non-native English speaker (who is not fluent) speaks English, two things happen: first, the speaker thinks in vernacular; he then translates that vernacular thought into English. Before the thought is even turned into speech, there's a delay. The process isn't automatic. But if you constantly listen in English, you begin to internalize the language into your brain When you think and reply to conversations, you begin to instantaneously pour out your thoughts in English without even making an effort.</p>

                <p>Listening in English trains your brain to think in English. As a result, you don’t have to first think in vernacular then go through the process of translating it.</p>

                <p>So the more you listen in English, the easier it is to think and speak in English. It would come naturally to you. Remember, speaking should come naturally! And listening will definitely help you accomplish that.</p>

            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">2. Listening helps you capture the “music” and “feel” of the sound patterns.</h3>
                <p>By sound patterns, I mean the pronunciation, the rising and falling intonation, the enunciation, the subtle twists of the tongue that makes the difference between mill and meal, fill and feel, tick and teak, tuck and tack, stick and steak.</p>

                <p>Not to mention the identical spelling but different pronunciation between read and read and lead and lead. And don’t even get me started on the word stress between address and address, and conduct and conduct. But when you’re mainly learning English through reading and writing, it’s almost impossible to notice these differences even if you were well-versed with the pronunciation rules.Reading will teach you new vocabulary. Writing will help you organize your thoughts. But listening will help you distinguish the difference between sounds that would have gone unnoticed if you were learning through reading and writing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">3. Listening helps you acquire the accent you want.</h3>
                <p>On my first day taking calls, I was so nervous. Like everybody else, when I’m nervous, my English gets worse. One customer said she could barely understand me. She said that my accent was too heavy. Thinking that I’m French, she started talking to me in French. Obviously, it made things more awkward. Because I’m not French; I’m a Filipina and we were not even allowed to tell our customers that we’re in the Philippines! (You know how it is!) Right then and there, the reality dawned on me: My English was bad; my accent even worse. And I knew I had to do something about it. I couldn’t imagine spending my entire shift listening to customers complaining about my accent. It was humiliating and just wasn’t sustainable. The good thing was, my salary at the call center finally allowed me to spare some money for internet café sessions. From YouTube, I would download videos of native English speakers talking, then convert them to mp3, and just spend all the free time I had listening. No pens, no papers, just me and my earphones.</p>

                <p>I think it’s accurate to say that I got so obsessed with acquiring the accent that I also paid attention to my customers’ accents and picked the ones I wanted to copy. Within months, I got more sensitive to the subtle sounds and accents that I finally got better at mimicking the “safe” accent or the accent that’s commonly understood by most English speakers. So if your goal is to acquire a certain accent, then spend the majority of English learning through listening.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">4. Listening helps you unlearn bad speaking habits.</h3>
                <p>Just as you’re learning the correct speaking habits, you’ll also learn to unlearn the bad speaking habits through listening. You begin to correct the wrong and bad speaking habits you’re used to and replace it with the right ones.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">5. Listening helps with grammar.</h3>
                <p>This will probably surprise you but listening does help you improve your grammar. To illustrate my point, read the following four sentences out loud and see how they make you feel after reading them. Try not to think about grammar. Just read them and see how they make you feel after hearing them.</p>
                <div>I knows.</div>
                <div>She understanded the lesson.</div>
                <div>You eats.</div>
                <div>They eated yesterday.</div>
                <div style="margin-bottom:2rem;">Obviously, these are all grammatically wrong.</div>
                <p>But how exactly did you know? Was it because you manually checked the grammar? Or was it because of that nagging feeling that something didn’t sound right with sentences? I am willing to bet that it’s the latter — that something didn’t sound right. Because these words are so common that we hear them all the time, we develop a prefabricated form of these words that another sound will never sound right. That’s how we know that something is wrong with the grammar.</p>
                <p>If you frequently listen to improve your English, this ability to recognize wrong grammar even before you manually check the grammar rules will be amplified. You gain a sense of what sounds right and what doesn’t. You will automatically know that it’s not supposed to be I knows but I know; not She understanded but She understood, not You eats but You eat, and certainly not They eated but They ate.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">How To Improve Your Englis For Call Center Through Listening</h2>
                <p>You might say, “But I have been watching English movies and listening to English audio to no avail. My English still hasn’t improved!” Well, in this section are my tips on how you could maximize listening so that it works in your favor instead of just wasting your time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">1. If your vocabulary is limited, listen to easy-to-understand audios and videos.</h3>
                <p>You might say, “But Sheina, my vocabulary is limited! I don’t know a lot of words. How can I even understand what’s being said?” If this is the case, then listen to videos and audios that are easy to understand. Children’s books for instance. They use simple and common words. What’s more, they’re designed to be easily understood. This is exactly the type of English that you want to listen to if your vocabulary is limited! This way, you’re able to listen to the sound patterns of the language while also understand the majority of what’s being said. Don’t worry about your limited vocabulary. Expanding your vocabulary is the least of your worries here when listening! Did you know that if you learn 800 commonly used words in English that you’ll be able to understand 75% of everyday conversations?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">2. Use subtitles.</h3>
                <p>If you’re having issues understanding the pronunciation and accent, then turn on the subtitles of whatever it is that you’re watching. This will help you get over the barrier of hearing a new accent for the first time. The more often you listen with subtitles, the time will eventually come when you won’t be needing subtitles anymore.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">3. Listen to audio materials that do not bore you.</h3>
                <p>I don’t care what English materials you listen to as long as it’s something that you truly enjoy. Learning a language shouldn’t bore you to death! The good thing is, with the rise of YouTube and Netflix, you don’t even have to pay too much to get hold of these learning materials. Follow any native English YouTubers whose contents you love. Watch all the English movies that tickle your fancy. Immerse yourself in the language but do NOT ever forget to have fun in the process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">4. Train your ears to be curious.</h3>
                <p>If you hear a sound that confuses you, take the time to repeat, taste it, roll it around your tongue until you get it right. This is how you acquire a specific accent along with its pronunciation. The good thing is it only takes a few seconds!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12" style="padding: 2rem;">
                <h3 class="h4">5. Repeat, repeat, and repeat.</h3>
                <p>All the tips that I’m giving here are useless if you’re not going to be consistent with listening. You have no excuse for saying the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>“I have no time.” Download the videos in mp3 format and listen to them while you commute or do your household chores.</li>
                        <li>“I have no internet at home.” Go to the internet café. Spend an hour downloading all you can and listen to them everywhere offline.</li>
                        <li>Your ability to benefit from listening will depend on how consistent you are. Without consistency, your efforts are just as good as nothing. Period.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12">
                <div style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 2rem; font-style: italic;">With listening, learning is effortless.</div>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    You can easily forget grammar rules but you can never forget feelings. While studying grammar rules has its own benefits, they’re just very tedious to learn. You have to memorize, you have to take note, and you have to deal with almost contradictory rules. Listening, however, is the exact opposite. You just have to stay put, no need to rack your brain to memorize the rules. The grammar rules will start to make sense as soon as you develop your listening skills to improve your English. You basically just have to let your subconscious mind do the work. As long as you do it religiously, then you can pretty much expect to see results within months of consistent sessions of listening.
